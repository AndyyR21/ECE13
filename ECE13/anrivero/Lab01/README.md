# What did you do in this lab?

In this lab, I created some c programs to run on the Uno32 Dev Kit.

# What mistakes did you make, and how did you identify and solve them?

During this lab I made a handful of mistakes. The first mistake I made was adding the BOARD.c/.h within the IDE rather than copy-pasting them into the folder, and then adding them into the project folder within the IDE. Without doing both, I would receive compiler errors saying that 
"(File A)/(File B) was not found". 

The second mistake I made not setting an amount of memory for the simulator which I realized after getting several errors when trying to build my solutions. 

# Do you have any feedback for us about this lab?
The only feedback I have for this lab is making it clearer on how to submit the lab.
